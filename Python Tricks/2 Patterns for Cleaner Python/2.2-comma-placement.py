Reason: String literal Concatenation
Multiple adjacent string or bytes literals (delimited by whitespace),

# In Python, you can place a comma after every item in a list, dict, or set constant, including the last item.
# That way, you can just remember to always end your lines with a comma and thus avoid the comma placement
# juggling that would otherwise be required.

Key Takeaways

* Smart formatting and comma placement can make your list, dict, or set constants easier to maintain.
* Pythonâ€™s string literal concatenation feature can work to your benefit, or introduce hard-to-catch bugs.
